                    <dd>My passion is developing the systems that the end user rarely interacts with directly, but absolutely must be in place (and function reliably enough) for them to have a satisfactory experience. Most of my experience has been with the C#, PHP, and JavaScript (Node, browser, and proprietary server-side scripting) languages. Of course, if the feature absolutely requires the use of AutoHotkey scripting, then you unfortunately have to use it, regardless of preference.</dd>
